# Windows-95-VM-Essentials
This repository will help you create a windows 95 machine! (Make sure to open and issue if something goes wrong)

With the files included in the release, you have everything (mostly) to install a Windows 95 Virtual Machine. Make sure that you use all the files so that everything is compatible with another. (VMWARE and other Virtual Machine services will NOT work)
